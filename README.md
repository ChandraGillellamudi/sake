# Sake - Swift Make

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xcodeswift/sake.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xcodeswift/sake)

Sake is a Swift command line tool that helps you automate tasks in your projects. It's heavily inspired by [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) and [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake).

## Motivation ðŸ’…

Why automating tasks using shell scripting or Ruby when you can do it in Swift, a language you are already familiar with?
Sake aims to provide a command line tool and the foundation to automate your tasks in Swift.

## Installation ðŸ¥‘

You can easily install rake using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew tap xcodeswift/sake git@github.com:xcodeswift/sake.git
brew install sake
```

## Setup âš’

1. Git clone the project `git clone git@github.com:xcodeswift/sake.git`.
2. Build `swift build`.

## Sakefile

Sakefile is the file that defines your project tasks:

```swift
// Sakefile
import SakefileDescription

Sake {
    $0.task(name: "clean", description: "cleans the project build directory", action: { (_) in
        // Cleans the build directory
    })
    $0.task(name: "build", description: "builds the project", dependencies: ["clean"], action: { (_) in
        // Builds the project
    })
    $0.task(name: "test", description: "tests the project", dependencies: ["clean"], action: { (_) in
        // Test the project
    })
}.run()
```

## Usage

#### Creating a Sakefile.swift
You can create an empty `Sakefile.swift` running the following command:

```bash
sake init
```

#### Working on the Sakefile.swift
You can edit the `Sakefile.swift` using any text editor. Nonetheless, we recommend you to use Xcode since you'll get syntax highlighting and code autocompletion for free. Sake provides a command to generate the Xcode project where you can edit the `Sakefile.swift`. You can generate the command by running:

```bash
sake generate-xcodeproj
```

> :warning Note: Xcode can only run Swift code in a `main.swift` file. Since the name of the file is `Sakefile.swift` you'll get some Xcode warnings. Ignore them!

#### Tasks

##### Run a task

```bash
sake task name_of_the_task
```

##### List all the tasks

```bash
sake tasks
```
