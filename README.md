# Sake

Sake is a Swift command line tool that helps you automate tasks in your projects. It's heavily inspired by [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) and [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake).

## Motivation ðŸ’…

Why automating tasks using shell scripting or Ruby when you can do it in Swift, a language you are already familiar with?
Sake aims to provide a command line tool and the foundation to automate your tasks in Swift.

## Installation ðŸ¥‘

You can easily install rake using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew tap pepibumur/sake git@github.com:pepibumur/sake.git
brew install sake
```

## Setup âš’

1. Git clone the project `git clone git@github.com:pepibumur/sake.git`.
2. Build `swift build`.

## Sakefile

Sakefile is the file that defines your project tasks:

```swift
// Sakefile
import SakefileDescription

task("build", dependencies: ["clean]) {
    // Build task
}

task("clean") {
    // Clean task
}
```
